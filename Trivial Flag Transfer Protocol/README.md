# picoCTF Trivial Flag Transfer Protocol

We're given a ["packet dump" file](https://wiki.wireshark.org/Development/PcapNg) named `tftp.pcapng` which we open using [Wireshark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireshark).

Most of the packets are of the "TFTP" protocol with some [ARP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol) packets in between. Also there seems to be a data transfer taking place using this very protocol as there are multiple [transmit-acknowledge sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#Connection_establishment). All the acknowledgement packets seem to be identical so we use the following search filter to filter them out

```
ip.src == 10.10.10.12 && tftp
```

On inspecting the packets further we see that packet number 23 is one of the first data packets and thus it's header carries the string "control.tar.gz" hence indicating that a compressed tar archive is being transmitted.

Thus we try to piece together the data packets so as to obtain the compressed tarball, hoping that this is not an encrypted protocol like HTTPS.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2916612/reconstructing-data-from-pcap-sniff suggests using [tcptrace](https://web.archive.org/web/20221201043700/http://tcptrace.org/) to piece together the packets but that's only for [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) packets and here we are dealing with a made up protocol named `TFTP`.
Came across another tool like tcptrace: [Justniffer](https://onotelli.github.io/justniffer/) but it's development stopped long ago, unable to install it.

After going through Wireshark's menu's more closely we finally manage to find what we were looking for. `File > "Export Objects" > TFTP` shows us a list of files that wireshark managed to piece through from the data packets, we can now save these files and analyze them.

On running the `file` command on the `program.deb` file we see that it's a ["Debian binary package"](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_(file_format)>). Since it might be dangerous to install the file on our system as it could be malicious, we run a simulation with [dpkg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dpkg) and that tells us the package name: `steghide`. Doing a google search on it reveals that it's a [stenography program](https://steghide.sourceforge.net/) that is able to hide data in files, for example hide a ZIP file within an image file.

The two ASCII text files contain gibberish text which we guess to be [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) encoded and thus we decrypt them with the tr command. On going through the messages we realise that we have already figured out the hints that are being given. The `instructions.txt` file might have been supposed to be read while going through the packets in Wireshark :P.

Running `binwalk` on the three [BMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format) files tells us that only `picture2.bmp` is useful as it has some compressed data embedded within it unlike the other two image files.

---

The data embedding was probably done using `steghide`, the stenography program that we discovered before. So we try to extract the data using the same program, but it asks for a password and we try everything we have:

- blank password
- the two text files, their filenames as well as contents
- their ROT13 decoded contents
- the word "DUEDILIGENCE" as it is placed after a hyphen.
- all the other filenames we got

That didn't work. So we perform the `steghide extract` command on the other two image files even though `binwalk` has told us that they are nothing more than bitmap image files. But to our surprise that gets us the flag.

> The lesson learnt out of this is that in Foresics we should not leave any stone unturned. Even the most innocent looking thing could be the culprit.
